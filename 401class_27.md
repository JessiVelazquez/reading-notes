# Research

Does a deployed React application require a server?

- It does not. React contains all of the necessary data and files to run an app in the browser.

Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

- Behavior Driven Development (BDD) tests use cases in a real-life scenario, which is more of an accurate an honest way of testing a front end application.

What does npm run build do?

- ```npm run build``` runs the "build" script from package.json and creates a production build of your application.

Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application

- A React app's entry point is index.html, which is a bare bones html file that contains a header and optional metadata, and then a single ```</div>``` inside of a ```</body>``` with an id set to "root". This places the entire React app on the page (required because the page renders in HTML, not JS). 

Then we have an index.js file, which will import the ReactDOM and an app.js file, and set a variable "root" equal to document.getElementByID('root'). It will run the app.js file at the DOM root by calling ReactDOM.render(<App />, root).

From here, the app,js is really where the app begins. React follows a structure where component files contain constructors with props and state, functions as needed, and a render/return section. The idea here is that data flows down from parent components into child components. Data is managed by setting state, and props can be passed down in line on components in the render/return.


# Definitions

**BDD:** Behavior Driven Development focuses testing on use cases and follows a principal that software testing should take into account both technical and business needs. This involves collaboration between developers, QA engineers, and non-technical or business participants. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)

**Acceptance Tests:** a testing technique performed to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specifications. The main purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and verify if it is has met the required criteria for delivery to end users [source](https://www.google.com/search?q=acceptance+tests&oq=acceptance+tests&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.4016j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

**mounting:** The process by which a React component is created and inserted into the DOM. The following functions are called in the process: constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount(). [source](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)

**build:** The process of setting up the production stage for your application.
