# **HTML Links**

- Created using the ```<a>``` element
- ```<href>``` attribute determines which page you are linking to
    - For linking to another site, use full URL
    - If linking to part of the same website, use the relative URL
    - To open the user's email browser and set up an email to an address, the ```<href>``` attribute starts with "mailto:" followed by the email address to be sent to
    - Use ```target="_blank"``` attribute to open link in new window
    - To link to another part of same page, use the "id" attribute on the element you are linking to, and call it in ```<href>``` using the "#" symbol.
        - can do this with an outside site if the element (part of the page) you are linking to has an "id" attribute

# **CSS Layout**

- All HTML elements are treated as boxes in CSS. 
    - Boxes are either block elements (new line) or inline (flow within content)

- If a block level element sits within another block level element, the outer box is the **containing** or **parent** element.
    - ```<div>``` element often used to box multiple elements together

**Positioning Schemes**

- Normal Flow
    - Every block element sits on a new line

- Relative Positioning
    - Moves an element from where it would be in normal flow
        - Shifting right, left, down, etc
    - Other elements surrounding it are not effected

- Absolute Positioning
    - Moves an element relative to its containing element

- Fixed positioning
    - Similar to absolute positioning, but places element in relation to the browser window, instead of the containing element.

- Floating elements
    - Positions elements to far left or far right of a containing box, where other text or elements can flow around them

**Ducket pages 365-403 are great references for how to create a variety of layout types**

# **Javascript**

**Functions**

- Group a series of instructions to achieve a specific task.
- Abstraction
- Can be called with one line of code
- **Paramaters** are passed in to the function
- **Return** values are returned, or spit out of the function
- You declare a function with the word "function" followed its name with parenthesis, then write the set of instructions that make up the function within the curly brackets.
- You can call it with just its name and parenthesis.
- Parameters are declared within the parenthesis when declaring a function
    - like ```getArea(width, height);```
    - then called with values like ```getArea(8, 12);```
- you can return a single value
    - in the example above, this would be area.
    - So, in the function declaration you write ```return area;```
- If you want to return multiple values, like area, volume, you declare variables within the function that use the parameters passed in:
    ```
    function getSize(width, height, depth) {
        let area = width * height;
        let volume = width * height * depth;
        let sizes = [area, volume];
        return sizes;
    }
    ```
    (source: Duckett page 95)
- You can then call this function like:
    ```
    let areaOne = getSize(3, 2, 3)[0];
    let volumeOne = getSize(3, 2, 3)[1];
    ```
    (source: Duckett page 95)

*Variable Scope*
- Local variables are declared within functions and only apply within
- Global variables are declared outside of functions, and still exist within functions

# **Pair Programming**

Two devs working together to tackle code
 - One is the driver
    - Handles the keyboard
 - The other is the navigator
    - Provides direction, manages text editor, version control, etc
    - Does nt write code

*Why?*
- This allows devs to touch on all elements of learning language:
    - listening
    - speaking
    - reading
    - writing

1. Greater efficiency (easier to catch mistakes)
2. Engaged collaboration (harder to get off focus, each partner pushes the other)
3. Learning from fellow students (everyone has different strengths)
4. Social skills (communication is key, getting comfortable with different personality types)
5. Interview prep (simulates a whiteboard style environment)
6. Job prep (used in the real world, so get used to it)
