    - ```<tr>``` for each row
        - ```<td>``` for each cell in the row
    - ```<th>``` for each heading (used like ```<td>```)

# **Objects - Javascript**

**Constructor Notation**
- use ```let object = new Object();```
    - The, each property has the notation ```object.name = 'Name';``` etc
    - To update an object's property's, use ```object.name = 'newName';```

- For several objects of similar type, you can template them, and then call constructor functions to create the instances. For example:
```
function hotel(name, rooms, booked) {
    this.name = name;
    this.rooms = rooms;
    this.booked = booked;
}
```
then:
```
let quayHotel = new Hotel('Quay', 40, 25);
let parkHotel = new Hotel('Park', 120, 77);
```
