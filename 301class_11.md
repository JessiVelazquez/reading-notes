OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated acces to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.

  - AKA secure, third party, user agent, delegated authorization.

- You see OAuth when you log into a website and offers one or more opportunities to log on nusing another site's logins, like "log in with Google" or "log in with Facebook"

OAuth scenarios almost always represent to unrelated sites or services trying to accomplish something on behalf of their users.

**How OAuth Works**

1. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
2. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
3. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
4. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
5. If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
6. The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
7. The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
8. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
9. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
10. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
11. The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
12. OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

There are competitors to OAuth, such as OpenID which is about authentication rather than authorization.

There is also SAML, which can handle both authentication AND authorization.

# **Authorization vs Authentication**

Authentication:

- Determines whether users are who they claim to be
- Challenges the user to validate credentials (for example, through passwords, answers to security questions, or facial recognition)
- Usually done before authorization
- Generally, transmits info through an ID Token
- Generally governed by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol
- Example: Employees in a company are required to authenticate through the network before accessing their company email

Authorization:

- Determines what users can and cannot access
- Verifies whether access is allowed through policies and rules
- Usually done after successful authentication
- Generally, transmits info through an Access Token
- Generally governed by the OAuth 2.0 framework
- Example: After an employee successfully authenticates, the system determines what information the employees are allowed to access

There are many different flows for this, including

Authorization Code Flow
Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange
Implicit Flow with Form Post
Hybrid Flow
Client Credentials Flow
Device Authorization Flow
Resource Owner Password Flow
