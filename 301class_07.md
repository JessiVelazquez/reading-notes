# **Ryan Tomayko Article**

This was a cool article about the way that the internet works, from a code point of view. I really enjoyed his analogy of nouns and verbs. I  was inspired to think on the scalability that that notion of having both nouns and universally applying verbs offers. The internet is a weird thing to describe because you almost always hear of it spoke in analogies. I think that there is so much abstraction rewquired to articulate something the scale of the internet that sometimes it can be difficult not to speak in analogies. But I thought that this article did a good job of detailiong its analogies and pairing that with real, technical examples that the article was effective.

I took 201 and recall the NYT article. That was a fascninating read that stayed in my thoughts for a days.
