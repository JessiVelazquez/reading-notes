 # The Four Things that Make a Computer a Computer Are:
 1. Input
 ```
 Converts physical input to binary information
 ```
 2. Storage
 ```
 Memory
 ```
 3. Processing
 ```
 CPU: Central Processing Unit
 - Stores information
 ```
 4. Output
 ```
 Converts information to physical output
 ```

# Binary Data

- One wire can either transmit or not. On/off, Yes/no, t/f, etc.
- This peice of information is called a **bit**. 
- With more wires sending binary data, you can represent more complex information.

## How Binary works

- In decimal system, we have each numerical position multiplying by 10.
```
example: 1965, where 
5 is in the "1" position (5)
6 is in the "10" position (60)
9 is in the "100" position (900)
1 is in the "1000" position (1000)

1000 + 900 + 60 + 5 = 1965.
```

- In the binary system, each position multiplies by 2 rather than by 10.
```
so, to represent the digit "9", we use 1001, where:
1   0   0   1     are "worth"
8x  4x  2x  1x    their value

- so according to above, values would be -

8   0   0   1  =  9
```

- Computers tend to handle this math for us
- Important thing is: **Any number can be represented by just 1's and 0's**

**Just Need a lot of Wires!**

 - With 8 wires, you can store numbers up to 255.
 - With just 32 wires, you can store numbers between 0 - over 4 billion...

 **Letters and Words**
 - Each letter out of 26 (alphabet) can be given a number, then represented with 1's and 0's.
 - Dog = D(4) O(15) G(7)... BINARY CODE!

 **Images and Pictures**
 - Screen made up pixels
 - Each pixel has a color
 - Any color can be represented in RGB (red, green, blue) with numerical values (253, 78, 141)... BINARY CODE!

**Sound**
- Any point on a wave form can be broken down into a number
- Any wave form broken down into series of numbers, the more frequent the more bits - 8 bit, 32 bit, etc... BINARY CODE!

## Software
- CPU takes commands that are stored in memory to know which circuits to use for which tasks
- Computers take commands from programmind languages (code), and coverts them into long strings of much simpler binary commands.

### Operating System (OS)
- The master program that manages how software gets to use the CPU
- Lets you install new programs by loading them into memory
- Lets you decide when a program is run by the CPU and gives it access to Input and Output devices

**Interesting Fact**
When you think your computer is running multiple programs at once, it is actually the OS switching between programs at lightnight speed
