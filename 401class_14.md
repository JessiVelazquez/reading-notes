Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

- FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

- You can code your server to receieve a message received notification upon a received message.

What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

- The observer design pattern [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)

How do you test an event driven system?

- Log everything! Messages may or may not be received, but you can test by using the logs. [source](https://blog.gurock.com/event-driven-application-architectures/)

**FIFO Queue:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. They provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing.[source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html)

**Pub/Sub:** a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are. Essentially, a system of broadcasting data and optional subscribing to the data. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
