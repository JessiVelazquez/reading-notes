# **HTML - Text**

**Text Markup Tags:**
*These effect the display of your text*

- ```<h1> - <h6>``` = Headers
- ```<p>``` = Paragraphs
- ```<b>``` = Bold
- ```<i>``` = Italic
- ```<sup>``` = Superscript
- ```<sub>``` = Subscript
- ```<br />``` = Line break
- ```<hr />``` = Horizontal rule (horizontal line to break up sections of text)

**Semantic Markup Tags:**
*These do not effect the display of text, but add other information*

- ```<strong>``` = Strong importance (often displayed in **bold**)
- ```<em>``` = Emphasis (for screen readers, often displayed in *italic*)
- ```<blockquote>``` = Block quote
- ```<q>``` = Inline quote (IE does not display quotations around these, so often avoided)
- ```<abbr>``` = Abbreviations and acronyms (using the "title" attribute creates a hover-over title)
- ```<cite>``` = Citation
- ```<dfn>``` = Define (use the first time you explain or introduce a new term that requires defining)
- ```<address>``` = Used for contact details of author (can use multiple ```<p>`` tags within element for email, physical address, URL, etc)
- ```<ins>``` = Content that has been inserted into document (displays as underlined)
- ```<del>``` = Content that has been deleted from document (displays with a line through it)
- ```<s>``` = Content that is no longer relevent but should not be deleted (original price next to sale price) - displays with a line through it


# **CSS**

CSS adds styles to HTML elements. CSS is formatted in "rules", with two parts:

    1. A **selector** (the HTML element without <> symbols)
    2. A **declaration** (indicates how elements referred to in the selector should be styled)

A CSS **declaration** has two parts of its own:

    1. A **property** (indicates the aspect you want to stylize (such as font or color)
    2. A **value** (specifies the settings you want to add for the property)

CSS rules looks like this:
```
h1, h2, h3 {
    font-family: Arial;
    color: yellow;
}
```

**Using external CSS**

- Use the ```<link>``` HTML element to call an external CSS style sheet, including attributes:
    - ```<href>``` = specifies the path to the CSS style sheet
    - ```<type>``` = specifies the type of document being linked to (value should be "text/css")
    - ```<rel>``` = specifies the relationship between the HTML file and file being linked to (value should be "stylesheet")
- If multiple CSS style sheets, use multiple ```<link>``` elements

**Using internal CSS**

- Place CSS within a ```<style>``` HTML element
    - Use the "type" attribute here with the value "text/css"

**CSS Selectors**

- You use selectors to select, or query the HTML elements you want to stylize.
- These include universal, type, class, ID, child, descendent, adjacent sibling, general sibling (**details are located on Duckett pages 237-238**)

**Cascading and Importance**

- If multiple rules apply to the same element, precedence goes to:
    - Whichever rule comes last in the CSS style sheet
    - Most specific selector (i.e. a "type" selector is more specific than the "universal" selector)
    - *Important* selector
        - You can place a "**!important**" after the property value to indicate it is of utmost importance and overrides other rules that apply to the same element
- Some properties are inherited by sub-elements (children) in the HTML, other are not.
    - You can make a child element inherit it's parent CSS stylings by using **inherit** as the property value
