# **HTML**

- To add an image, you use ```<img src= alt= title=/>``` 
- where to place image in HTML is important
    - Before a paragraph will place it as a block element above the paragraph
    - Inside the start of a paragraph will align first line of paragraph with bottom of image
    - in the middle of paragraph will put it between the words of the paragraph

- images need to be jpg, png, or gif
    - jpg handles colors the best
    - use gif or png for flat color pics, like logos, etc

- save image at the same pixel size it will be used on the website

- image dimensions and cropping
    - familiar with using paint, but many programs to do this

- Vector images are resolution independent
    - You can increase the dimensions of the image without effecting the quality of it

- Animated gifs are series of images displayed in fast succession

- For a partially transparent image, use transparent gif or png

- For figure and captions use ```<figure>``` and ```<figcaption>``` attributes

**Color**

- You can specify using RBG, hex code color, or color name (page 249)

- For foreground color, use property (color:)

- For background color, use property (background-color:)

```
h1 {
    color: rgb(100,100,90);)
}
```

Color Terminology

- RGB is red, green, and blue values. like this (100,100,88)

- Hex Codes are RGD in hexadecomal code. RGB(102, 205, 170) renders to #66cdaa.

- Color names - there are 147 color names spported by browsers. Hard to remember though, and limiting, so not commonly used.

HSL Colors

- In CSS3, we have HSL. This indicates hue (on a color wheel in dgrees out of 360), saturation (1-100), and lightness (0-100) - page 255

Contrast

- Important to contrast foreground and background.

- High contrast is good for headers, they pop. But big text blocks can be hard to read with high contrast.

- Use medium contrast for long text blocks.

- CSS3 has an opacity property, called RGBA where "a" is alpha value for opacity. Also can be used with HSL as HSLA. (page 254)

**Text**

Types:
- Serif (have the pointy serif thing)
- Sans serif - no serif
- monospace (each letter same width)
- cursive
- fantasy (decorative)

Choices
- font family (font)
- fant-face (user has to d/l the font)
- images (you can create a graphic that contains the text as you want it to appear)
- sifr (font is embedded in flash move (flash player is going away, is this relevent?))
- cufon (uses JS to create either a SVG or VML version of the text)

Type scales
- font pt scale was actually developed in the 16th century
- You can achieve this using pixels, percentage, or ems (page 276)

The following text attributes can be referenced on Ducket pages 273-291:
- font-family
- font-size
- font-face
- bold
- italic
- text-transform (uppercase and lower case)
- text-decoration (underline and strike)
- line-height (leading (aka vertical space between lines))
- letter-spacing, word-spacing
- text-align
- vertical-align
- text-indent
- text-shadow
- first-letter, first-line
- link, visited (styles links, or styles them after clicked)
- hover, active, focus

There are attribute selectors where you can query (select) attributes based on their value. On Duckett page 292:
- existence
- equality
- space
- prefix
- substring
- suffix
