# Research

Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

- A user enters a URL into a browser and clicks enter.

- Browser puts together an HTTP request (create, read, update, or delete) to be sent to the server that hosts the given URL

- The request is sent to the server (the internet is made of wires - ISPs like Comcast, etc!)

- The server receives the request, and puts together a response

- The server send the response back to your computer via the same ISP/wired system that sent it to the server

- Your browser can read the response and displays it as the webpage

Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

- In terms of the WRRC cycle, it is the physical computer, often located in large server farms/data centers owned by Amazon, Google, etc, that hosts the website you are requesting to see upon typing in a URL

What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

- Move the files that make up your web application or site from your local machine to a server machine (often in a data center), so that the whole world has access to view your site on the web

# Vocab

**Server:** A physical computer that hosts and provides data for other computers to access via the internet.

**Pub/Sub:** A broadcast style of request/response: there is no gaurantee of a recipient, instead the server sends (puublishes) the data and clients can choose to listen (subscribe) to it.

**WRRC:** The web request response cycle - the system by which a client (often a personal computer) makes a request over the internet to a web hosting server, which in turn sends data back to the client to be displayed by a web browser.
