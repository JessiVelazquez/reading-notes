# Growth Mindset
A "growth mindset" is understanding that human beings are maleable and can change, learn, and grow. This is opposed to a "fixed" mindset wherein we are only so capable of certain things, and those things remain static. With a growth mindset, challenges are viewed as opportunities and successes are seen not as a race to a singular prize but as building off of one another. In this sense, there is always "room at the top" because we are always creating "the top". A growth mindset is important in learning because it will allow you to believe first and foremost that you *can* learn, and *can* adapt and get better at things, which will open the doors for one to pursue more new learning opportunities and persist in the effort it takes to master them.

## Reminders to self
The following are **three reminders to myself** of how to remain in a growth mindset:
  1. Remember that success is not a competition with a winner and a loser, but rather that one individual's successes can inspire and create new opportunities for others' successes to build off of.
  2. Remember the purpose of criticism is to learn - getting things wrong is a natural part of the learning process.
  3. No one is born knowing everything - or anything at all, for that matter. Everyone who has mastered something started from ground zero at one point. Remember that when you feel like you are struggling.
