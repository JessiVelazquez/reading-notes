**Array.map()**

- This method returns a new array which is the result of executing the function provided in () on each element of the array. The original array is unaffected.

**Array.reduce()**

- Array.reduce() reduces an array to a single value. I like to think of this like making a reduction sauce, where lots of ingredients are "reduced" to one product. In array.reduce(), you set an initial value and then iterate through the array,where the initial value is changed in some way by each iteration.

**Superagent()**

```
superagent
  .get(url)
  .query(query)
  .then(superagentResults => {
    const movieArray = superagentResults.body.results.map(agent => {
      return new Movie(agent);
    });
    inMemoryDB[city] = movieArray;
    response.status(200).send(movieArray);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('superagent error', err.url);
  });
```

```
getItems = async () => {
  const response = await superagent.get(`${API_SERVER}/items`);
  const items = response.data;
  this.setState({items});
  console.log("getitems", items);
}
```

**Promise Objects**

- A promise is essentially a placeholder or proxy for an eventual function evalualation or value which may take the code some time to run. Rather than return an immediate value, the function returns a promise to submit the value when completed. This proxy value allows the code to continue running synchroniously, while we *asynchroniously* await the actual return value.

- It is like telling someone "Your doctor appointment is on Wednesday at 2pm, but we don't know which doctor you are seeing yet. So, go ahead and set a calendar reminder for 2pm with the doctor name left off and we will notify you 3 hours before the appointment which real doctor you are seeing.

**Are all callback functions asynchronous?**

- Not all callback functions are asynchronous. If you have a function call within a function call (parent/child) where the child function must finish before the parent function can complete, it is synchronous. An example of this would be the forEach() array method, which takes a callback function and applies it to each element of an array (child) before it is able to return it's result (parent).

Syntax:

```
array.forEach(callbackFunction (param1, param2) {
  Do something here
});
```
