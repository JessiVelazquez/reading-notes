# Research

When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

- Basic is used to login directly to an API with username/password. Bearer is used when you need to make calls to get the token and one to get the data. [source](https://community.mega.com/t5/REST-API/Basic-Auth-vs-Bearer-Token/td-p/23476)

What does the JSON Web Token package do?

- JSON Web Token package is what is used to create a valid JWT, which is an incrypted password token with a header, a payload, and signature.

What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

- You never want to store secrets in Github repo's. You should never forget your secret. You should store a hashed version.

# Definitions

**Encryption:** Encryption protects data by scrambling it with a randomly generated passcode, called an encryption key. [source](https://www.virtru.com/blog/authentication-encryption/)

**Token:** a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA. [source](https://jwt.io/introduction)

**Bearer:** Bearer Tokens are the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0. A Bearer Token is an opaque string, not intended to have any meaning to clients using it. [source](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/)

**Secret:** a piece of information (string) known only by the application and developer.

**JSON Web Token:** an incrypted password token with a header, a payload, and signature.
