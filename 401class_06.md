# Research

Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

- a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern#:~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20the%20singleton,mathematical%20concept%20of%20a%20singleton.)

Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

- Singleton patterns are limited to one single instantiation. They are different from global variables in that they do not take up space in the global namespace, and different from static classes in that they can be passed as parameters and can have their instances swapped out for testing purposes.

If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

- I would utilize my resources and network and ask someone who knew more about strategic approaches to the middleware design process. JK, kinda! I know I would need to use the request, response, and next parameters for each piece of middleware. I would then decide what I needed middleware for - whether that is authentication, messaging, translation for data exchange, API security, etc. I would then research available options and compare their pros and cons. If there were not viable existing options for my needs, I would look at writing middleware.


# Terms

**Router Middleware:** A piece of code that comes in the middle of the request and response. It takes the request and modifies it before passing to either the next piece of middleware or the client. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63106648/what-is-router-middleware-in-express)

**Dynamic Module Learning:** a method of continously assessing your performance and activity, then using data and analytics to provide personalized content in real time to reinforce concepts that target each student's particular strengths and weaknesses.

**CRUD -> REST Method Matches:** Create = PUT, Read = GET, Update = PUT, Delete = DELETE

**Mock Testing:** A testing approach that lets you make assertions about how the code under each test is interacting with other system modules. Dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the bahavior of the real objects. This is like how we use supertest or supergoose to mock the server in our test files.

# Prep Materials

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Password encryption, user authentication, secure password storing

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Password strength controls, layers of "salt", cookies

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I'm looking forward to implementing password strength controls - I have always wondered why they are important if ther password is properly encrypted anyway.
