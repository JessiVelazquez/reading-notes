Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

- React toolkit essentially provides a simple solution for state management in Redux, which can be quicker to the end game and also can provide simplified code in your project. However, it is less maleable and by removing some of the need to code things in Redux, it's "out of the box" nature can block a true understanding of Redux.

What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit.

- Simplification. Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

# Definitions

**redux toolkit slices:** A slice in Redux is a function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. This API is the standard approach for writing Redux logic. [source](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice)

**namespace:** a set of names that can ID and refer to objects - a namespace is one compartment of names, in one namespace one name is used within the space, but in another namespace it has a fresh referential meaning.
