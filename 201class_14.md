# **NY Times Article:**
(https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

I elected to read this in one fell swoop, because it was written much more fluidly than the textbook style readings we usually take notes on; I did not want to break the flow of the article and risk retention loss by attempting to note take every small bit along the way. Therefore, I will not attempt to bullet point the article out. I found it fascinating and validating of interpersonaly things I believe to be true from experience. It is interesting that the early thinking of "the most effective groups are friends outside of work" was not entirely wrong, it was just misdirected - in truth, there is no need for a group to be friends outside of work, but the same thing that makes friendships work is the thing that makes groups work - psychological safety and emotional bonds. Surprise, surprise.

I have always felt the most comfortable, productive, and happy in a work setting when I feel at ease, free to be myself, and that group members are free to act informally around each other. There shouldn't have to be two versions of yourself at home and at work - feeling as though you have to change your behavior or put on your "work face" really gets in the way of thought, ideas, and progress in my opinion. 

# **CSS**

**Transforms** - code snippets taken from https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/

- Rotate:
```
.box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
}
```

- Scale
```
.box-1 {
  transform: scale(.75);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: scale(1.25);
}
```

- Translate (move in more than one direction at once)
```
.box-1 {
  transform: translateX(-10px);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: translateY(25%);
}
.box-3 {
  transform: translate(-10px, 25%);
}
```

- 2D skew
```
.box-1 {
  transform: skewX(5deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: skewY(-20deg);
}
.box-3 {
  transform: skew(5deg, -20deg);
}
```

- There is more at this resource about transforming perspective, and manipulating 3D elements, etc

**Tranasitions and Animations** - from https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/

- These are rules like :hover, :focus, :active, :target, etc. Elements must have style rules for both before and after the event takes place, like a hover.

- More great transitions are described at https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users

Transitions described at the link above can be things like:

- Fade in/out
- Change color
- Grow/shrink
- Rotate elements
- Square to circle
- 3D shadow
- Swing
- Inset border
