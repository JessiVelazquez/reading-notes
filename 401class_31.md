# Research

Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

- React apps are built with components that only APPEAR to be different HTML elements. In terms of html pages, the entire React app renders in one <div/> we call "root" in index.html.

If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

- You would want it inside the Browser Router, as this wraps around the entire app. But you would want to keep it outside of any routes if you wanted it to render on each page "by default". You could also just put it in every single route, but this may be a less effective strategy.

What does props.children contain?

- it contains whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. [source](://stackoverflow.com/questions/49706823/what-is-this-props-children-and-when-you-should-use-it)

# Definitions

**Composition:** a development pattern based on React's original component model where we build components from other components using explicit defined props or the implicit children prop. [source](https://formidable.com/blog/2021/react-composition/)

**Children/Child Components:** React components that inherit props from a parent component - they can be rendered within parent components too. Two sibling components with the same parent cannot directly "speak" to one another they must pass props through the parent.

**Hash Routing:** a routing system that uses just the "anchor" part of the route - the bit following the "#" - to determine the routing behavior and keep your UI in sync with the URL.

**Link Routing:** A routing system that uses <Link /> in React to handle the routing behavior of a React application.
