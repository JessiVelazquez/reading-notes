Why is access control important?

- It is important to control which users have access too which functionality - that way not every user can have access to secure documents, or be able to perform actions like deleting an account - only admin or high level users should be able to do those things. Access control gives you the ability to set different settings for different user types.

Describe an application that would need access control.

- A message board needs access control - regular users can post on topics, but only admins should be able to lock threads, remove users, or add new subjects to the message board.

What is a role used for?

- A role is a class of users you can assign functionality to, and then by assigning a user that role, they inherit that functionality.

Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

- In Discretionary Access Control, each object with an owner who controls access to that specific object, so to globally change access for a lot of users, you would have to drill down to the owner of each object and change it there. In Mandatory Access Control, the access is granted or denied by rules in the OS each time a subject attempt to access an object, so as you add more granularity to users/user types, you would need to write more and more rules, which may cause contradiction. Role Based Acccess Control can easily be controlled by adding new user types and setting their access rights globally. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control)

# Definitions

**Authorization:** The process of determining the access rights of a user within a system.

**Role Based Access Control:** A system where users are assigned different classes, or user types (roles), and each role has a set of access rights. So any user with that role will have a certain set of defined access rights. Rights are changed globally at the role level.

**Capabilities:** The specific functions within an application that a role has access to, or is restricted from.
