# **Objects**

- Have properties, which then have values 
    - Known as key/value pairs

- Have methods
    - These are functions, but within an object they are called "methods."

You would create an object like this:
```
let hotel = {
    name: 'Quay',
    rooms: 40,
    booked: 25,
    checkAvailability: function() {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
    }
};
```

# **Document Object Model (DOM)**

- DOM is a seperate set of rules that tells the browser how javascript can access and update the contents of a webpage while it is in the browser window.
    - Often referred to as an **Application Programming Interface (API)**.

**The DOM Tree**

- A "family tree" style model that a browser creates for a webpage it loads and stores in memory.
- Can have 4 main types of **nodes**:
    1. Document Node
    2. Element Node
    3. Attribute Node
    4. Text Node

**Working With the DOM Tree**

1. Access the Elements
    - Select an individual element node:
        - Use ```getElemtentById()```
        - Use ```queySelector()``` (uses CSS selector, returns first matching element)
    - Select Multiple Elements (Node Lists)
        - Use ```getElementsByClassName()``` (selects all elements that have a specific value for the "class" element)
        - Use ```getElementsByTagName()``` (Selects all elements that have the specied tag name)
        - Use ```querySelectorAll()``` (Uses CSS selector, to select ALL matching elements)
    - Traversing Between Element Nodes
        - Use ```parentNode``` (Selects the parent of the current node)
        - Use ```previousSibling/nextSibling``` (Selects previous or next sibling node)
        - Use ```firstChild/lastChild``` (selects first or last child node of current element)

2. Work With Those Elements
    - Access/Update text nodes
        - Select text node using access options above
        - Use ```nodeValue``` to access/update its contents
    - Work With HTML Content
        - ```innerHTML``` allows you to access child elements and text elements
        - ```textContent``` allows you to access just the text content
        - **DOM Manipulation**
            - ```createElement()```, ```createTextNode```, ```appendChild()/removeChild()```
            - Allow you create new nodes, add nodes to a tree, remove nodes from a tree
    - Access or Update Attribute Values
        - ```className/id``` lets you update the value of the ```class``` or ```id``` attributes
        - ```hasAttribute```
        - ```getAttribute```
        - ```setAttribute```
        - ```removeAttribute```

3. Caching DOM Queries
    - In the code below, variable ```itemOne``` does not store the element/node being queried, it stores a *reference* to it
    - ```let itemOne = getElementByID('one');```

**Nodelists**
- When a DOM method *can* return more than one element, it returns a nodelist
    - each value has an ID index, like an array. But not an array, a *collection*
- Selecting from a nodelist

    - The ```item()``` method
        1. Select elements that have a ```class``` value of "hot" and store the nodelist in a variable
        - ```let elements = document.getElementsByClassName('hot')```
        2. Use the ```length``` property to check how many elements were found. If one or more are found, run the if statement
        - ```if (elements.length >= 1) {```
        3. Store the first element from the nodelist in a variable called firstItem
        - ```let firstItem = elements.item(0);```
    
    - The array syntax method (**preferred** - faster)
        1. Create a nodelist containing elements that have a ```class``` attribute whose value is "hot", and store it in the variable ```elements```
        - ```let elements = document.getElementsByClassName('hot')```
        2. If that number is greater than or equal to one, run the code inside the if statement
        - ```if (elements.length >= 1) {```
        3. Get the first element from the nodelist
        - ```let firstItem = elements[0];```

- You can use a for loop to loop through all of the items in a nodelist and update them accordingly:
```
let hotItems = document.querySelectorAll('li.hot');
for (let i = 0; i < hotItems.length; i++) {
    hotItems[i].className = 'cool';
}
```

**Adding or Removing HTML Content**

- ```innHTML`` Property
    1. Store new conent as a string in a variable
    2. Select the element whose content you wish to replace
    3. Set the elements ```innerHTML''' property to be the new string
        - (To remove content, set the variable in (1) to blank)
- DOM Manipulation Methods
    1. The idea is you use DOM methods to create element and text nodes, then attach them or remove them from the DOM tree
    2. To add content:
        - Use a DOM method to create new content one node at a time
        - Use another DOM method to attach it to the DOM tree in the right place
    3. You can remove content from the DOM tree using a single method

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- When a hacker places malicious code into a site
- You do not want user access to any HTML elements on the site
- Happens when user input is going to database

To Defend Against:
- Ensure users can only enter character types that are required for that entry
- Should only strore user entires as text (strings) and place that content in variables
    - *innerHTML* can be dangerous and open up XSS attacks because it allows direct access to the HTML
- Excape certain characters so they process as characters (not code): 
    - Example: ```&amp; &quot; &lt; &gt;``` are code for characters which display as &amp; &quot; &lt; &gt; after being escaped
- If you have user provided URL links, use the javascript method encodeURLComponent() to encode characters like  /  ?  :  etc

**Attribute Nodes**
1. Select the element node that carries the attribute you are targeting/updating: ```document.getElementByID('one')```
2. Follow it with a period (member operator)
2. Use one of these methods to work with the attribute:
    - ```getAttribute()``` - gets the value of the attribute
    - ```hasAttribute()``` - checks if element node has a specified attribute
    - ```setAttribute()``` - sets the value of an attribute
    - ```removeAttribute()``` - removes an attribute from an element node
    - ```className``` - gets or sets the value of the **class** attribute
    - ```id``` - gets or sets the value of the **id** attribute

**Other**

Use jQuery to overcome inconsistent implementation of the DOM across different web browsers

Browsers offer tools to view the DOM
    - Google "DOM Inspector"
    - Firefox dev tools has a 3D/Box view of the DOM
