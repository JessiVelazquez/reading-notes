# **Charts.js**

- a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5â€™s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page.
- Visualizing data is a hugely attractive component of JS
    - Requires plugins, like most languages use. This is a one of JS's

1. Use the HTML ```<canvas>``` element:
```
<canvas id="countries" width="600" height= "400"></canvas>
```
2. Write a JS script that will retreive the context of the canvas
3. Get/create data

- Can create line charts, pie charts, bar charts

**The Canvas Element**

- Like an ```<img>``` element, but no ```<src>``` or ```<alt>``` tags
- width and hight
    - Can be styled further in CSS, but CSS needs to respect the original ratio specified in the ```<canvas>``` tag, or box will appear distorted
- Can utilize an HTML ```<id>``` tag just like any other body element
- Can put fallback content inside the ```<canvas>``` element for old decrepid browsers like IE6 that don't support it


- The canvas grid starts in upper left and goes by pixels (x, y)

- You can draw shapes with Canvas:
    - Rectangles
    - Paths (lists of points connected by lines)
        - These have methods:
            - beginPath()
            - closePath()
            - stroke()
            - fill()
    - Triangles
    - Arcs
    - Quadratic curves and whatnot
