# Research

What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?

- It refers to process of a component rendering on the page. Phases such as componentWillMount() and componentDidMount() are stages within a component's life cycle.

Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect?

- useCallback() wrapping can help in avoiding regeneration of functions when the functional component re-renders. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57156582/should-i-wrap-all-functions-that-defined-in-component-in-usecallback#:~:text=useCallback%20will%20help%20in%20avoiding,caused%20by%20recreation%20of%20functions.&text=You%20are%20specifying%20a%20function%20as%20a%20dependency%20to%20useEffect%20.)

Why are functional components preferred over class components?

- In functional components, you can change state from anywhere in your componentry through the use of React hooks.

What is wrong with the following code?

```
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```

- You would not want to use useEffect() React hooks inside of a for loop. React hooks should be called directly within React functions, not called inside of a loop.

# Definitions

**state hook:** the useState() hook allows you to use/update state in functional components

**effect hook:** the useEffect() hook allows you to perform side effects, such as fetching data, or re-rendering the DOM. The useEffect() hook tells React that the component needs to do something after render. [source](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

**reducer hook:** this is an alternate to the useState() hook, but is more complex. After setting an initial state of the items you have in state on a component, you can write a reducer function to change them dynamically and/or together.
