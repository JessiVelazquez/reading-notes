**SQL Databases are relational** vs **NoSQL are primarily called non relational**

- SQL databases are tabled, while NoSQL databases are document-based, kay-value pair, graph, etc.

- SQL have predefined schema while NoSQL have dynamic schema.

- SQL are vertically scalable (add RAM, CPU, SSD on a single server), while NoSQL are horizontally scalable (add more servers)

- SQL are scaled by increasing the horsepower of the hardware, while NoSQL are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

- SQL uses structured SQL lamguage, whereas NoSQL is based on collection of documents, sometimes called UnQL, and the syntax varies from database to database.

```
SQL: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres

NoSQL: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neoj4, CouchDb
```

SQL better for complex queries

NoSQL is better for hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data, similar to JSON

NoSQL only has community support, different than the support available for SQL

SQL used for financial transactions



# MongoDB

Document-based, stores data in JSON-like documents.

- Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.
-0 Scalability: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.
- Manageable: It is easy to use for both developers and administrators. This also gives the ability to shard database
- Dynamic Schema: Its gives you the flexibility to evolve your data schema without modifying the existing data


The second article goes over specific techniques of NoSQL data mapping. I am finding this fascinating, but being such a long and rigorous article, I am going to bookmark and save it for a time when I am not fading.
