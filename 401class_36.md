What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

- Local storage is vulnerable to hack attacks using javascript - someone can get your local storage key and access the data.

Explain 3rd party cookies.

- Third party cookies are cookies that are stored by third party sites. They are mostly used to track users between websites and display more relevant ads between websites. Another good example is a support chat functionality provided by a 3rd party service.

How do pixel tags work?

- A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. Because it is so small, it can hardly be seen by visitors of a website or email recipients. The website operator or sender of an email adds the tracking pixel using a code in the website’s HTML code or email. This code contains an external link to the pixel server. If a user visits the destination website, the HTML code is processed by the client. Data can be tracked about the user such as:

- Operating system used (gives information on the use of mobile devices)

- Type of website or email used, for example on mobile or desktop

- Type of client used, for example a browser or mail program.

- Client’s screen resolution

- Time the email was read or website was visited

- Activities on the website during a session (when using multiple tracking pixels)

- IP address (gives information on the Internet Service Provider and location)

# Definitions

**cookies:** Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience. [source](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/cookies)

**authorization:** the process of asserting what user capabilites a given user has once authenticated on a site.

**access control:** the process of authentication (you are who you say you are) and authorization (you can do the things you are allowed to do) on an application or site.

**conditional rendering:** having certain components of an application render based on conditions, in React we import react-if to implement this in the component rendering tree.
