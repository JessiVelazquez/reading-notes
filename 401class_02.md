# NOTES:

1. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?
    -  PUT replaces the original resource with a new resource, whereas PATCH supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource - so put replaces with a new, patch mutates the existing.

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
    - [https://www.mock-server.com/](https://www.mock-server.com/)
    - [https://beeceptor.com/](https://beeceptor.com/)

3. Compare and contrastAPIDOcs and Swagger. Which HTTP status codes should be send with each type of (un)successful API code?

    Swagger, with it's UI, is more popular. Swagger uses plain json that can be parsed, giving the advantage of other 3rd party APIs in order to create http client and more. APIDoc even provides information about APIDoc->Swagger converting so people can swiotch to Swagger.

    500 - Internal Server Error
    404 - Route not found (Client)
    403 - Request is forbidden

4. Compare and contrast SOAP and REST:

    These both allow you to create your own API (Application Programminig Interface) for data transfer between applications. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. SOAP is used for enterprise-level web services that require high security and complex transactions. SOAP came first, has higher complexity, and requires more bandwidth and slower page load times. Thus, REST came along. It has more flexible architecture. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. To create a REST API, you must follow:

    1. Uniform interface – Requests from different clients should look the same, for example, the same resource shouldn’t have more than one URI.
    2. Client-server separation – The client and the server should act independently. They should interact with each other only through requests and responses.
    3. Statelessness – There shouldn’t be any server-side sessions. Each request should contain all the information the server needs to know.
    4. Cacheable resources – Server responses should contain information about whether the data they send is cacheable or not. Cacheable resources should arrive with a version number so that the client can avoid requesting the same data more than once.
    5. Layered system – There might be several layers of servers between the client and the server that returns the response. This shouldn’t affect either the request or the response.
    6. Code on demand [optional] – When it’s necessary, the response can contain executable code (e.g., JavaScript within an HTML response) that the client can execute.

Define these terms:

Web Server: A computer that runs websites. It's purpose is to store, process, and deliver web sites [source](https://raygun.com/blog/soap-vs-rest-vs-json/#:~:text=As%20opposed%20to%20SOAP%2C%20REST,protocol%20but%20an%20architectural%20style.&text=It%20allows%20different%20messaging%20formats,services%20have%20a%20better%20performance)

Express: Express is a free and open source web application framework for Node.js. It is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily. [source](https://www.besanttechnologies.com/what-is-expressjs)

Routing: a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. In the router part of a server file, you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page. [source](https://divpusher.com/glossary/routing/#:~:text=Routing%20or%20router%20in%20web,simple%20routing%20example%20from%20Laravel.)

WRRC: Web request response cycle. How data is exchanged between a server and client on the web. Requests go from client to server, intercepted by middleware. The server gets the request, puts together the response, and sends it back to the client.

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Node Package Manager - In 301, I never really understood exactly what "npm" was, or what Node was.
- CLI (command line interface)
- Test driven development

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I would like to get better at knowing what tests to write, and when to write them - basically having a better understanding of development from a TDD angle.
- Express - I understand we have been using Express, but I am not clear when we are using it vs when we are not - for example, these docs say that Express provides mechanisms for writing handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs - we are doing that, but I thought that was just javascript? I would like to know more about what functionality specifically is Express.
- Mock API tools - I have been using them, but I think I still get somewhat confused upon landing on them. I get more comfortable when I am on a roll and working with one, but that doesn't happen right away.

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I am excited to get more experience using databases. I would generally like to get much more comfortable with backend server development. I am really attracted to the pragmaticism of back end dev work, where the job is getting and sending data rather than front end which is an adventure, often not in the best sense of the word...
