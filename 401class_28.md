# Research

Can a parent component access the state of a child component?

- Yes, you can access the child's state using Refs. we will assign a Refs for the child component in the parent component. then using Refs we can access the child's state. I have not had any experience with this, but found this information at [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-access-childs-state-in-react/#:~:text=How%20to%20access%20child's%20state%20in%20React%3F,-Last%20Updated%20%3A%2001&text=In%20React%20we%20can%20access,can%20access%20the%20child's%20state.)

What can be passed along in a prop variable?

- You can pass functions or any kind of data as a property from a parent to a child component - commonly used are class functions that live on the parent and state items that live on the parent.

How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

- It must be passed as a prop down into the child.

# Definitions

**Component props:** props are arguments passed into React components. These can be functions, state items, or any data. You pass them inline in JSX and they look like HTML attributes but act like javascript.

**Component state:** a list of variables chosen by the dev whose values are stored on a React component. These can only be updated from the component where they live, but can be passed to other components as props if they need to work with other components in the design of the application.

**Application state:** This is global state that can be accessed by all components, such as in a chat application you would have users and their messages stored in global applicationn state.

# Preview

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- state, props, and handler functions

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- redux state management, hooks, and functional components

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I am really looking forward to seeing what this whole redux state management thing is all about.
