How granular should your reducers be?

- The more granular your reducers are, the less components need to re-render upon state changes. This creates better application performance. So, they can be as granular or as monolithic as you want, I suppose - but the aforementioned reason would be the argument for granularity.

Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched

- My perspective is that this would be a good thing - as you can have a number of different state items update all around your page based on a singular event. Seems like it would be better for performance - less code running, more DRY, etc. But you need to be careful about naming - probably want to make it something super unique so you don't get unintended state changes occurring.

Name a strategy for preventing the above

- Employ a very specific naming approach, so you are not unintentionally firing off tons of reducers by saying something like "get" or "click" or something. Also - in a professional environment working on a big application, another dev could come through a year down the road and also name an action something generic like "click" without knowing you already are using that.

**store:** store is the global state management layer where redux does it's work.

**combined reducers:** this pulls all of your reducers into one central reducer that can be passed to the app through the index.js file.
