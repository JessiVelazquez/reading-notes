## Questions

Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware.

  - User Authentication
  - It provides a 'middleman' so that both systems are not needing to talk directly to one another; thus if one goes down, the other can continue to run.
  - User messaging-orientwed middleware

True or false: The route handler is middleware?

  - They are not middleware functions by definition. If such function is used on routing methods then they are only handler functions. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58925276/what-is-the-difference-between-a-route-handler-and-middleware-function-in-expres#:~:text=They%20are%20not%20middleware%20functions,they%20are%20only%20handler%20functions.)

In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

  - By not calling next(), or by not having next in its params - i.e. (req, res) instead of (req, res, next).

At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

  - Middleware has access to the request object, the response object, and the next function. It is applied to the request after the server gets the request.

What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

  - This could happen if you are telling the script to respond twice.

## Definitions

**Middleware**: Software that acts as a bridge between a server and client.

**Request Object**: The object that a client sends to a server to execute a create, read, update, or delete function.

**Response Object**: The object that a server sends back to a client after receiving the request object.

**Application Middleware**: Middleware that is bound to an instance of express using app.use() [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29457008/whats-the-difference-between-application-and-router-level-middleware-when-rou#:~:text=Application%20level%20middleware%20are%20bound,to%20an%20instance%20of%20express.)

**Routing Middleware**: Middleware that is bound to an instance of express.Router(). [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29457008/whats-the-difference-between-application-and-router-level-middleware-when-rou#:~:text=Application%20level%20middleware%20are%20bound,to%20an%20instance%20of%20express.)

**Test Driven Development**: A development style wherein you write tests first, before writing code.

**Behavioral Testing**: An agile software development process, stemming from TDD, that is based on the use of user stories, which are written down in a dedicated document. BDD relates to how desired behavior should be specified. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)

## Preview

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

  - Route Methods
  - Route parameters (difference between params, query, body)
  - Route paths (specifically how to handle :name or :id open ended paths)

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

  - Hoisting
  - Prototype methods
  - Binding

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

  - I am excited to get more experience doing what we are doing. I feel like day by day I get a little more aware of what is happening in my code and a little more capable of writing and debugging things. But I still have a long way to go and I just want reps.
