# Research

Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?

- Yes, but the parent must pass them down. This is either in an ES6 (props) pass in a functional syntax or in the constructor(props)/super(props) in class syntax.

When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?

- If a child component is wrapped inside of a parent component, it will render as its own component WITHIN the parent - meaning it will only appear on the page when the parent is rendered.

Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?

- Yes - a component can be rendered multiple times in different places - on it's own or wrapped within a parent component.

What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children

- Using the spread operator to pass all of it's props to the child.

# Definitions

**props.children:** a special prop, automatically passed to every component, that can be used to render the content included between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. These kinds of components are identified by the official documentation as “boxes”. [source](https://codeburst.io/a-complete-guide-to-props-children-in-react-c315fab74e7c)

**composition:** Composition in React is a development pattern based on React's original component model where we build components from other components using explicit defined props or the implicit children prop. [source](https://formidable.com/blog/2021/react-composition/)

# Preview

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- wrapping components inside of parent components, props.children, the spread oeprator

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- the spread operator, functional components, redux state management

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

Redux with functional components - it sounds complicated yet super awesome.
