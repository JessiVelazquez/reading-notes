# **Local Storage for Web Applications**

- There is a need for a storage solution for web apps that:
    - Has a lot of space to offer
    - exists on the web client
    - persists beyond a page refresh
    - is not transmitted to the server

**History**

- IE was the BIG NAME back in the day
- ```userData``` allowed web pages to store up to 64 KB of data
- 2002 Adobe allowed Flash objects to store u to 100 KB
- 2007, Google put out Gears, which provided an API to an embedded database using SQLite - gave unlimited data storage in SQL data tables
- All of these solutions are either only available to specific browser, or reliant on third party plugins. 

- So, HTML5 set out to provide a standardized API, implemented natively and consistent in multiple browsers, without needing third party plugins

**HTML5 Storage**

- A way for web pages to store named kay/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. 
    - Data persists even after you navigate away from the page, close the browser tab, exit the browser.
    - Data is never transmitted to the remote web server.
- IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, iOS, Android

**How it works**

- Based on key/value pairs
- store and retrieve based on the key (a string)
- Data can be any type supported by Javascript, but is stored as a string
    - Means that in Javascript, you need to use parsers like ```partInt()``` or ```parseFloat()``` to coerce data back into Javascript functionality
- How to get, set, and remove key/values is gone over at http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html

- To track changes in data, you can trap the **storage** event, which is fired on the **window** object whenever ```setItem()```, ```removeItem()```, or ```clear()``` is called and actually changes something - for example if you change a value to it's already set value, you are not changing anything and the storage event will not fire.

**Limitations**

- 5 MB per origin space.
    - However, you are storing strings only so it goes further.
