## **Questions**

**Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

1. There is usually a reduction in bugs and defects
2. Code is easier top refactor
3. Project is easier to finish because you "draw out" your end product in your tests

**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**

When testing CRUD actions with a database, you may want to use beforeEach() and afterEach() to add and remove the test data from the database before and after you run the tests.

**What is a downside to Test Driven Development?**

You can write bugs into the tests, causing you to think your code is working when it is not what you really desire.

**What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**

A class defines a type that can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is actually an object instance. [source](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up)

**Why REST?**

REST plays nicely using json. REST totally separates the user interface from the server and the data storage.

-----------------------------------



## **Definitions**

**Functional Programming**: A method of development by creatinig pure functions. Places emphasis on expressions and declarations rather than execution of statements.

**object-oriented programming (OOP)**: A method of development that focuses on objects that contain both data and functions.

**class**: A template for creating an object in javascript es6

**super**: a method of object property inheritence.

**this**: a method of object self reference.

**Test Driven Development**: A programming style in which tests are written first, before code, which is then written to pass before being refactored.

**Jest**: a javascript testing framework.

**Continuous Integration**: A development process which allows for changes that developers make to be continiously implemented into a shared repository. Every time the code changes, it is tested and built automatically.

**REST**: Representational State Tramnsfer - A web protocol that uses a representation of a resource to transfer state which lives on the server into the application state on the client. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10418105/what-does-representational-state-mean-in-rest)

**Data Model**: A representation, often a diagram, that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of other entities. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model#:~:text=A%20data%20model%20(or%20datamodel,properties%20of%20real%2Dworld%20entities.)

## **Preview**

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

  - Document based databases, NoSQL modeling techniques, testing in supergoose

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

  - I am looking forward to learning more about the designs of NoSQL/non relational databases, diving further into modularity of schema, and learning about Big O in whiteboarding.
