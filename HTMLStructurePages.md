Create some fictional characters who may come to use your site - make a table with data fields like income, location, age, occupation, gender, etc.

- Understand potential **goals** and **motivations** for these people coming to your site.

- Example: Joe's dog has been misbehaving and he is looking for a professional dog trainer.

- What information do visitors need?

- How often will people visit your site?

### Create

Site maps - Where will info go? Think it terms of page structure - how many branches below Home Page, what info is on each. Drawn like a tree.

Wireframes - Sketch how the information will go on each page. Could be in photoshop or just on pen and pad. Helps to determine how to fit info on each page.
