# Research

What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

- Packets are intended to transfer data reliably and efficiently. Instead of transferring a large file as a single block of data, sending smaller packets helps ensure each section is transmitted successfully. [source](https://techterms.com/definition/packet)

UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

- UDP does not establish a connection before sending data, it just goes ahead and sends, like sending a letter without acknowledgement of receipt. It is used for things like media streaming, where you send the data regardless of a recipient. [source](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19620-01/805-4041/6j3r8iu2f/index.html)

Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

- A socket interface can have 65535 maximum connections between an application and the IP sockets interface. [source](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=domain-maximum-number-sockets)

Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

- Multiple sockets can be listening on the same port.

Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

# Definitions

**Observer Pattern:** The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)

**Listener:** A listener is a piece of software that logs events from the underlying framework (GUI toolkit), such as clicks, keypresses, etc. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing))

**Event Handler:** a function that takes an event and performs some action upon that event, often with a time-based queue. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing))

**Event Driven Programming:** EDD - a programming paradigm where the flow of execution is determined by events. This is contrary to object oriented programming where everything is an object and functionality rests with the object - here in EDD, functionality occurs based around events.

**Event Loop:** a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20the%20event,or%20messages%20in%20a%20program.)

**Event Queue:** responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. [source](https://www.google.com/search?q=event+queue&oq=event+queue&aqs=chrome..69i57.1968j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

**Call Stack:** This is the order of execution that an interpreter relies on, or the order in which code is run. A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc. [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)

**Emit/Raise/Trigger:** The emit method, when raised, triggers all callback functions assigned to an event to "fire", or get called. 

**Subscribe:** The subscribe object defines the handlers for notifications you receive. It is responsible for inserting callbacks to subscribers. Part of the publisher/subscriber (pubsub) method.

**Database:** a repository where data from an application is sent and stored, and can then be queried from.

# Preview

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Call stack, Emit, WebSockets (though still a bit perplexed by sockets)

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- how sockets work, event queues, notifications

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- If notifications means we will be designing apps that push user notifications (that can be then subscribed to or unsubscribed from), then I think that is really cool!
