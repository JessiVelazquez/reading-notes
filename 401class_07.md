# Questions

Write the following steps in the correct order:

1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
3. Make a request to a third party API-endpoint
4. Redirect to a third party authentication
5. Make a request to the access token endpoint
6. Receive access token
7. Receive authorization code

What can you do with an authorization code?

- You can authorize a user to purchase, sell, or transfer items, or enter information in a secured space. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorization-code.asp#:~:text=An%20authorization%20code%20is%20an,into%20a%20security%2Dprotected%20space.)

What can you do with an access token?

- You can make API requests on behalf of the user. [source](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/#:~:text=Access%20tokens%20are%20the%20thing,in%20transit%20and%20in%20storage.)

Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

- OAuth allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password. [source](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-oauth/#:~:text=OAuth%20doesn't%20share%20password,without%20giving%20away%20your%20password.)

# Definitions

**Client ID:** Represents a unique browser or devide and is assigned to each unique user of your application. [source](https://www.optimizesmart.com/understanding-the-difference-between-client-id-and-user-id/#:~:text=A%20Client%20ID%20represents%20a,unique%20user%20of%20your%20website.)

**Client Secret:** A secret known only to your application and the authorization server to protect your resources by only granting tookens to authorized requestors. [source](https://auth0.com/docs/applications)

**Authentication Endpoint:** an HTTP endpoint that clients can use to identify a user or obtain an authorization code (which is then later exchanged for an access token) to be able to post to their website. [source](https://indieweb.org/authorization-endpoint)

**Access Token Endpoint:** where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. [source](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/#:~:text=Access%20tokens%20are%20the%20thing,parts%20of%20a%20user's%20data.&text=The%20token%20endpoint%20is%20where,access%20token%20for%20a%20user.)

**API Endpoint:** the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. [source](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/endpoint/)

**Authorization Code:** an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorization-code.asp#:~:text=An%20authorization%20code%20is%20an,into%20a%20security%2Dprotected%20space.)

**Access Token:** used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API. [source](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/access-tokens)
