# **Layout**

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.
- Boxes are either inline or block style
- Elements can be contained within other (parent) boxes/elements

- ```<div>``` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The ```float``` property moves content to the left or the right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width)
- Paghes can be fixed width or liquid layouts
- Devs keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and keep the cheddar up in those first 600 pix to make sure to lure ya in (aka demonstrate relavance sans scrolling)


**Positioning Schema**

1. Normal Flow
    - Every block element sits on a new line

2. Relative Positioning
    - Moves an element from where it would be in normal flow
        - Shifting right, left, down, etc
    - Other elements surrounding it are not effected

3. Absolute Positioning
    - Moves an element relative to its containing element

4. Fixed positioning
    - Similar to absolute positioning, but places element in relation to the browser window, instead of the containing element.

5. Floating elements
    - Positions elements to far left or far right of a containing box, where other text or elements can flow around them


**Fixed Widtch Layouts**
- Do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
- Measurements are given in pixels.

**Liquid Layouts**
- Stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window
