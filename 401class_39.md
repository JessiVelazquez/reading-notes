# Research

What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

- Fire off an asynchronous action in the lifecycle method getEffect() or componentWillMount() of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39356517/correct-way-to-pre-load-component-data-in-reactredux#:~:text=1%20Answer&text=The%20most%20'redux%2Dlike',Component%20that%20wraps%20your%20app.)

When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?

- Export action creators.

# Definitions

**middleware:** pieces of software that sit between other systems - request/response, OS/applications, etc. There are several types, like auth, translation, etc.

**thunk:** Thunk allows you to return functions. This allows for delayed actions, including working with promises. One of the main use cases for this middleware is for handling actions that might not be synchronous, for example, using axios to send a GET request.
