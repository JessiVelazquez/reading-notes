Thinking like a programmer boils down to thinking like a problem solver.

Problem solving steps:
1. **Understand** what is being asked. If you can explain the problem in plain english, then you understand the problem. 
2. **Plan** your solution. Write down the exact steps, and take time to analyze the problem.
3. **Divide** Most important step! Break down the problem, don't solve in on big step! Begin with the simplest. Solve all sub problems, then you connect the dots.
4. The best programmers are more curious about bugs and errors than being irritated. Take a step back abd look from a different angle.

2. Define the problem
3. Askl why this problemn is occuring 5 times. As multiple possibilities come up, also ask why on those 5 times.
4. Know when to stop - when the "why" answers are less than productive
5. Address the root causes
6. Monitor to ensure you are truly solving the problem.
