# GitHub Pages
So, what is GitHub Pages?
GitHub pages is the easiest way to make a nice looking website, especially if you are already using GitHub to store files. Rather than a complicated process,
GitHub makes it easy to create, format and host webpages through your GitHub account interface.

## Markdown Overview
Markdown is a language for formatting text on the web, and it is the primary way to create and structure GitHub pages. In order to use Markdown in GitHub, you must format your page in GitHub's edit window by using text formatting "commands" embedded within the text. These commands tell the page how to format the text and are only visible to you in the editing view - they are not visible in the published content. Below are a few of the basic components:

### Headers
- Headers are preceded by the # symbol. 
- For different header "levels", you can use multiple # symbols.
- There are up to six levels of headers, signified by # - ######.

### Text
- You can make something bold by using two * symbols. Example: **This is bold**.
- You can make something italic by using one * symbol. Example: *This is italic*
- You can link to a website by using first brackets with the link title and then the link in parentheses. Example: [Cool Wind Map](http://hint.fm/wind/index.html)

### Lists
- You can make lists like numbered lists:
  1. Joe
  2. Beth
  3. Eric

- Or bullet points using dashes (-)
  - Joe
  - Beth
  - Eric

### And more!
- There are many more ways to format text in Markdown language, which can be viewed [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
