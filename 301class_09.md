Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

Pure Functions

- Returns same result if given the same arguments

- Does not cause observable side effects

Immutability

- state of immutable object cannot change

- if you want to change an immutable object, you can't - have to create a new object with a new value.

Referential Transparency

- Pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

First Class Functions

- functions are also treated as values and used as data

- First class functions can:

  - refer to it from constants and variables
  - pass it as a parameter to other functions
  - return it as result from other functions

High order fucntions

  - takes one or more functions as arguments, or
  - returns a function as its result

Strategies:

  - Return early from functions
  - Cache variables so functions can read like sentences
  - Check for web API's before implementing your own functionality
