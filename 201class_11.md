# **Images in CSS**

- Control the size with width/height
- Use float to align left or right 
    - create image classes, one for each float style
- To center images, assign it ```display: block``` since images are by default inline.
    - Then go margin: auto on left and right to center it
- Can apply background images to either the whole page or to element boxes, like ```<p>``` elements
    - Parameters such as repeat, repeat x, repeat y, fixed, scroll
    - If an image is not repeated, you can use the ```background-position``` property to determine its position
        - options like left top, left center, right bottom, etc
- Images can have ```:hover``` properties and rules
- CSS3 is incorporating color gradient property for backgrounds
    - look this up to use

- **Low contrast** is important for a background image, so text can be legible on top of it

# **Practical Information**

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Basically, knowing the keywords users search to end up on your site, and placing those keywords in the right places on your site to achieve search results

**On-page**
- words in your HTML text, utilizing the ```alt``` property on images

**Off-page**
- Getting other sites to link to yours
    - Sites that are relevant/same topic as your site
    - SE's look at the words between the opening and closing ```<a></a>``` tags, so use meaningful keywords, not just "click here" jumbo.
