# Research

What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?

- Once a connection is established between the web client and the server, data can be passed back and forth in two directions on the same port. This is beneficial because it saves ports and sockets.

Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?

- It doesn't use HTTP by default, but was designed with HTTP in mind as a fallback option. It can wortk with HTTP in the sense that web socket servers and HTTP servers to coexist on the same TCP port. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37836130/socket-io-why-does-it-need-an-http-server#:~:text=The%20premise%20on%20which%20your,%2C%20which%20it%20isn't.&text=Even%20when%20websockets%20can%20be,%2Fsocket.io.js%20.)

What happens when a client emits an event?

- All listeners connected to that socket and listening for that event are fired, and the event is sent to the server.

What happens when a server emits an event?

- Listeners on the client side that are connected and listening for that event will fire.

What happens if a client “misses” an event?

- In a Windows environment, the computer could explode. Otherwise, the event is ignored. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32816290/what-happens-with-unhandled-socket-io-events)

How can we mitigate this?

- Have handlers that catch these and decide based on other state what to do with them. In a Windows environment, you're out of luck. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32816290/what-happens-with-unhandled-socket-io-events)

# Definitions

**Socket:** an endpoint for sending and receiving data across a computer network. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket)

**Web Socket:** two-way communication system between the servers and the clients, which mean both the parties communicate and exchange data at the same time. [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/websockets/websockets_overview.htm)

**Socket.io:** a node library for real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed. [source](https://socket.io/)

**Client:** the entity asking for data in an exchange.

**Server:** the entity sending the data in an exchange.

**OSI Model:** The seven layers of abstraction of the internet. At the base level, things are physical, at the top it is presentation.

**TCP Model:** A concise version of the OSI mode, only containing 4 layers - network access, internet layer, transport layer, and application layer. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/)

**TCP:** Transmission Control Protocol. A communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks. [source](https://www.google.com/search?q=tcp+definition&oq=tcp+definition&aqs=chrome..69i57.2576j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

**UDP:** User Datagram Protocol - a communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network. It's an alternative to the transmission control protocol (TCP). [source](https://www.sdxcentral.com/resources/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/#:~:text=User%20Datagram%20Protocol%20(UDP)%20%E2%80%93,referred%20to%20as%20UDP%2FIP.)

**Packets:** Bits of data that are sent through UDP.
