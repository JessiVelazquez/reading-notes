# Research

Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer().

- useMemo is a React hook that memorizes the output of a function. useMemo accepts two arguments: a function and a list of dependencies. useMemo will call the function and return its return value. useReducer is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second. [source](https://everyday.codes/javascript/react-usememo-and-when-you-should-use-it/)

Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

- React has written it this way as a general convention - this is mostly so it can be visibly seen right away what is a hook. Best to stick to the practice.

What do custom hooks usually do?

- Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks. [source](https://www.wix.engineering/post/custom-react-hook-when-software-design-meets-react-hooks#:~:text=Custom%20hooks%20allow%20us%20to,use%20cases%20to%20reusable%20hooks.)

Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

- useRef() is like a "box" that can hold a mutable value in its .current property. It is commonly used to access a child component imperatively. [source](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)

Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

- you would use an API call within a useEffect() hook that takes both the API URL and id if you are sending a PUT or DELETE route.

# Definitions

**reducer:** In React, useReducer allows us to access reducer functions for state management. A reducer function determines changes to an app's state by using the action it receives.
