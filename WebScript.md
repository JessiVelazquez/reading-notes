# Writing a Web Script

- HTML: **Content layer**
- CSS: **Presentation layer**
- Javascript: **Behavior layer**

## Javascript has its own file

- Like html and css, javascript files are text files with the extension .js
- You can call the .js file from the HTML file using the *script* element

## Javascript: The Language

Statements
- Each statement is one instruction for the computer.
- they end with a semicolon.

Comments
- Write comments telling what your code does
- Multi line symbol is /*.
- Single line is //.

Variables
- Variables are objects that represent data.
- For example, width x height = area, width, height, and area are variables. The values could be 10 x 15 = 150.
- You announce variables and assign them values like this - where quantity is the variable and 3 is the value:

```
var quantity = 3
```

Data Types
- Boolean: (T/F)
- String: 'Hi, it is me'
- Numeric: '0.75'

Using a variable to Store a Number
- Example:

```
var price;
var quanitity;
var total;

price = 5;
quantity = 14;
total = price x quanity;
```

- For string, same thing but use '' around it: 
```
var username
username = 'molly"
```

- if quotes are inside of string, use doubles: 
```
var title
title = "molly's donuts"
```
