# **How the Web Works**

- You use your browser to request a website by typing its web address.

- Your computer contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) which acts like a telephone book and tells your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.

- This IP address allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.

- Web server sends the website back to your browser.

- Your browser translates the website's code, usually HTML/CSS/JS to display it to you.

*(This information can be found in Chapters 1, 18, 8, and 17 of Ducket HTML/CSS book)*


# **Structuring Pages with HTML**

*(Very good information on visual design tactics can be founnd in HTML and CSS book page 452 - Chapter "Structure")*

**Target Audience**

- Who is visiting your site? Why? Important to design the site for *them*, not *you*.

**Understand who is visiting your site - Create some Characters**

- Create some fictional characters who may come to use your site - make a table with data fields like income, location, age, occupation, gender, etc.

    - Understand potential **goals** and **motivations** for these people coming to your site.

    - Example: Joe's dog has been misbehaving and he is looking for a professional dog trainer.

    - What information do visitors need?

    - How often will people visit your site?
        - Some sites benefit from changing information more frequently
        - For example, a site selling fashion will change more frequently than a site selling a setady service like plumbing.

**Create**

- Site maps

    - Where will info go? Think it terms of page structure - how many branches below Home Page, what info is on each. Drawn like a tree.

- Wireframes 

    - Sketch how the information will go on each page. Could be in photoshop or just on pen and pad. Helps to determine how to fit info on each page.

**Communicating with Design**

- Visual Hierarchy **Duckett page 465-468**

    - Important big, less important small
    - More details in Duckett

- Grouping

    - Group types of information together in different parts of the page

- Similarity

    - Similar items or objects should be presented in a similar way, visually.

# **HTML - Other Notes**

- HTML structures a webpage.

- Uses tags to articulate pieces of information. 

    - Tags have an opener and a closure tag.

- In HTML5, you do not need to the <!DOCTYPE> tag, but it is still considered best practice, so we use it.

- The title and header come first.

- The body must encapsulate all code, with tags for things like H1, H2, img, text, etc. 

The most important thing to remember is to refer to Ducket HTML/CSS for style guides in detail.
Another option is to Google HTML tag syntax when uncertain how certain elements should be written.

- Comment out code lines with the tag ```<!-- text goes here -->```

- Unique ID for elements allows you to style that element uniquely in CSS style sheet.
    - You can utilize this by using the global (available for any element) attribute "id":
        ```
        <p id="unique_name">This is the text for the unique id element.</p>
        ```

- Class attribute allows you to call classes of elements:
        ```
        <p class="classexample">This text will format as part of this class.</p>
        ```

- Block vs inline elements
    - Block elements start on a new line/take up the entire horizontal plane of the page.
        - Such as  ```<h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>```
    - Inline elements continue on the same line as their neighboring elements.
        - Such as ```<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>```

- Grouping elements
    - Use the ```<div>``` tag
    - Can block text, image elements, etc.
    - Still can style each individually, but by using a class attribute you can do things like control the amount of space the entire ```<div>``` element takes on the page, white space around it, etc.
    - **Use the ```<span>``` tag to group elements inline.**

    ```
    Think of this as : you individualize each element, then use <div> tags to group individual elements into another layer of elements (abstraction).
    ```

- iframes
    - Provide a window to another page.
    - Common use is embedding Google Maps into a page.
    - Use the ```<iframe>``` tag with src = URL of page shown in frame, height, width attributes.

- meta
    - Open tag (does not have a closing tag
    - Specifies metadata about the page - attributes like description, keywords, robots, author, pragma, expires

- Escape characters
     - Escape characters are used when you need to place an HTML language symbol in your page like text.
     - **See Duckett pages 193-194 for details.**

**New HTML5 Elements (that reduce ```<div>``` usage)**

- ```<header>``` and ```<footer>``` elements
    - These can apply to the whole page, or an individual ```<article>``` or ```<section>```.

- ```<nav>``` is used to contain the major navigational blocks.
    - You can call this, then place a list element (```<ul>```) within it, and place list items (```<li>```) within the the list element.

- ```<article>```
    - Used to contain any section of a page that could stand alone.
    - An article can have other articles nested within it.
    - Could be a blog entry that has a title element, image element, and text element within it.

- ```<aside>```
    - If outside an article, should contain info related to the overall page - links to other sections of the site, search box, recent tweets from auther, etc.
    - If inside an article, should contain info related to the article that is not essential - like a pullquote, or glossary of terms.

- ```<section>```
    - Groups related content together, like latest news, top products, newsletter signup

- ```<hgroup>```
    - The heading group groups together multiple headings h1-h6 that can be treated as a single heading.

- ```<figure>``` and ```<figcaption>```
    - Should contain pieces of info that are references from main flow of the article
    - Such as
        - Images
        - Videos
        - Graphs/diagrams
        - Code samples
    - ```<figcaption>``` should be included which provides a text caption for the figure element.

- ```<div>``` element should still be used to group these new element types, or when there is no specific element tag for the grouping you desire to utilize.

- You can place a ```<a>``` element around an entire block level element or article to create a link out of the entire article.

**Making New Elements Work in Older Browsers**

- Older browsers do not recognize these elements as block level. 
- Should add a line of CSS like this that states they should be treated as block level elements:
    ```
    header, section, footer, aside, nav, article,
    figure, figcaption {
        display: block;}
    ```
- For CSS to work in Internet Explorer versions <8, link to HTML5 shiv Jacascript (hosted on Google's servers) inside a conditional comment within the ```<head>``` element. **As shown on Duckett page 447.**

# **Javascript**

Javascript makes web pages interative. Example are:
- Slideshows
- Forms
- Partial page reloads
- Filtering data

## **Script**

A script is a series of instructions for the computer, akin to:
- a recipe
- a handbook 
- a manual

The goal needs to be defined first.
- Tasks must be defined, then broken down into series of steps.
- remember a computer only understands commands it already knows (delete, add, open, etc), and yes/no binary questions.

## **Computers think programmatically**

- Recall that everything eventually boils down to 1's and 0's. Everything else is achieved through abstraction.

**Objects**

- Objects have properties:
    - If the object is a car, its properties could be:
        - *Make*
        - *Color*
        - *CurrentSpeed*
        - *FuelType*

- Objects have events:
    - If the object is a car, events could be:
        - *brake*
        - *accelerate*

- Objects have methods:
    - If the object is a car, methods could be:
        - changespeed() - increases or decreases the value of *currentspeed* property

**A Script puts these things together**

- **Events** can trigger **methods**
- **Methods** can retrieve or update an objects's **properties**

**The Document Object**

- Models the current webpage loaded into a browser.

    - Properties are things like the URL, title, last modified, etc

    - **Events** are things like load, click, keypress.

    - **Methods** are things like 
        - write() - adds new content to the document
        - getElementbyID() - access an element when you state its ID

**How a Browser Sees a Page**

1. Browser reveives HTML page.
2. Browser creates a model and stores it in memory.
    - Like a family tree where the head is document object, then the html object, and then branching out into various other objects, taken from the HTML structure, which are called **nodes**.
3. Browser shows the page on the screen using a **rendering engine**
    - The rendering engine uses either default stylings for HTML elements, otherwise it will use the CSS style sheet you call in your script.

**Fitting HTML, CSS, and Javascript together**
- HTML is content layer
- CSS is presentation layer 
    - Called by using the ```<link src="stylesheet.css"></link>``` element in HTML file
- Javascript behavior layer 
    - Called by using the ```<script src="javascriptfile.js"></script>``` element in HTML file
