# How the Web Works
- You use your browser to request a website by typing its web address.

- Your computer contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) which acts like a telephone book and tells your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.

- This IP address allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.

- Web server sends the website back to your browser.

- Your browser translates the website's code, usually HTML/CSS/JS to display it to you.

# Structuring Pages with HTML

*(Very good information on visual design tactics can be founnd in HTML and CSS book page 452 - Chapter "Structure")*

**Target Audience**

- Who is visiting your site? Why? Important to design the site for *them*, not *you*.

**Understand who is visiting your site - Create some Characters**

- Create some fictional characters who may come to use your site - make a table with data fields like income, location, age, occupation, gender, etc.

    - Understand potential **goals** and **motivations** for these people coming to your site.

    - Example: Joe's dog has been misbehaving and he is looking for a professional dog trainer.

    - What information do visitors need?

    - How often will people visit your site?

**Create**

- Site maps

    - Where will info go? Think it terms of page structure - how many branches below Home Page, what info is on each. Drawn like a tree.

- Wireframes 

    - Sketch how the information will go on each page. Could be in photoshop or just on pen and pad. Helps to determine how to fit info on each page.

**Communicating with Design**

- Visual Hierarchy

    - important big less important small

- Grouping

    - Group types of information together in different parts of the page

- Similarity

    - Similar items or objects should be presented in a similar way, visually.

# HTML - Other Notes

- Structures a webpage.

- Uses tags to articulate pieces of information. 

    - Tags have an opener and a closure tag.

- In HTML5, you do not need to the <!DOCTYPE> tag, but it is still considered best practice, so we use it.

- The title and header come first.

- The body must encapsulate all code, with tags for things like H1, H2, img, text, etc. 

The most important thing to remember is to refer to Ducket HTML/CSS for style guides in detail.
Another option is to Google HTML tag syntax when uncertain how certain elements should be written.
