- Uses V8 JavaScript Engine

- But adds features like file system API, HTTP library, etc

**Basically, Node is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers = a javascript runtime

- It is recommended to use a version manager to be able to install different versions of Node and switch between them.

You can run js files straight from the terminal

(I was able to run the hello.js and index.js from the terminal using Node)

**npm**

*The* package manager for javascript

To install a package globally run ```npm install -g name-of-package```

You can also install packages locally to a project.

    - Here we install lodash, which gave us a package.json file and a whole bnunch of js files in thelodash folder.
    
    - This then enabled us to run the javascript code in this test.js file we created in the terminal to get an output of [1,2,3].

        - I was able to do this easily, but I have no idea what lodash did...

You list packages used under "dependencies" in package.json, which allows any dev to clone your project and use npm install to install whatever packages it needs to run

**What is Node.js used for?**

Installing (npm) and running (node) various build tools that are designed to automate the process of developing a modern javascript app.

**Node allows us to run javascript on the server**

*Traditionally:*

when you connect to server, like apache, it spawns a thread to handle server request, and this blocks your code from running until the database loopup is complete. Must be complete before code can process the result.

    - Ineffficient because a lot of threads. Can make things slow or site can go down.

*With Node:*

Event-driven, single threaded.

When new server request comes in, server will start processing it, hits blocking I/O operation, registers callback, before continuing to process the next event. When I/O has finished (another type of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request.

    - This is called asynchronous (non-blocking) behavior

- Node is good suited for apps that require real time interaction or collaboration - chat sites, apps like CodeShare, screenshare stuff.

- Good for building API's where you're handling lots of requests that are I/O driven

**Advantages of Node**

- Speed and Scalability

- Use same language (javascript) for front and back end

- Node speaks JSON


# **Pair Programming**

Reasons:

1. Greater efficiency

2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning from new students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work environment readiness
