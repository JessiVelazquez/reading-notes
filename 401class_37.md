# Research 

Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

- Redux is more complex, and heavier weight than Context API which is lighter and requires less code/learning curve. However, Redux is great for larger applications where there are high frequency state updates. It is preferable for prop drilling because it attempts to re-render on each state update, and render only the updated components, and this can be tracked in the console.

What is the purpose of a reducer?

- A reducer is a function with the purpose of changes an application's state.

What does an action contain?

- An action contains a type and a payload - the type triggers the reducer function and the payload is the data you are sending to the reducer function.

Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

- They must create immutable objects. Replacing state with a new state object, with just the desired elements updated also allows to revert back to the previous state if there is an error, and allows for time travel in redux dev tools.

# Definitions

**immutable state:** state in redux is not changeable - in the sense that to update state, a new state object is created which replaces the previous state object.

**time travel in redux:** because state is recreated each time there is an update, the previous state objects are stored and can be accessed in the redux dev tools. This is called "time travel", because you can go back in time and see the state at various points in the past.

**action creator:** A function that returns an action object - which has type and payload properties. The type triggers a reducer function which changes state, and the payload is the data that will update in state.

**reducer:** a reducer is a function that "hears" an action and then updates state based on the payload that is passed in from the action creator.

**dispatch:** dispatch is how you access functions. Reducer files export their action creator functions into index.js in store, and functional component files can pull those functions from index.js in store to gain access to them, so that actions within the render of the functional component are able to update state globally.
