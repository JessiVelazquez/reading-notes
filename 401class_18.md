What are serverless functions?

- Serverless functions are functions that are triggered in the cloud from pieces of cloud infrastructure. On AWS for example, you can set up a database, a route manager, and a function manager where you upload your function code, and set triggers on routes and allow your function to perform CRUD actions on your database. Essentially a back end in the cloud.

If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

 - I would write a normal backend server RESTful route CRUD system. Lambda functions emulate normal servers, so therefore normal servers "emulate" a Lambda systems. 

 Describe how a CDN works

 - **Content Delivery Network** - a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user. Without a CDN, content origin servers must respond to every single end user request. [source](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/cdn/what-is-a-cdn.jsp#:~:text=A%20CDN%20)
