# **Debugging and Error Handling in Javascript**

- Know the order of execution of a script
    - Understanding execution contexts and stacks give you a better ability to locate errors in your code
- Execution contexts are either global or local (within a function)
- Child functions can access parent functions' variables
- Whenever the interpreter comes across an error, it looks for error handling code
- Browsers create **error objects** and give information about the error
    - SyntaxError, ReferenceError, URIError, EvalError, etc

Where is the problem?
- Look at the error message
    - What line did it occur on?
    - Type of error?
    - Have the console tell you how far the script is running
    - Use breakpoints where things are going wrong to let you pause script execution and inspect the values stored inside variables

What is the problem?
- When you set breakpoints, you can see if the variables around them have the values you expect. If nt, look earlier in the script
- Break out pieces of code to test sections of it
    - Write values of variables into the console
    - Call functions from the console to check if they are returning what you expect them to
    - Check if objects exist and have the methods and properties you think they do

Setting breakpoints - Chrome:
1. Select the ***Sources*** option
2. Select the script you are working with from the left hand pane.
3. Find the line number you want to stop on and click on it
4. When you run the scrtipt, it will stop on this line. You can now hover over any variable to see its value at that point in time.

Stepping Through Code
- You can step through the code line by line to see the value of the variables at any point in time
- Debugger will naturally step into functions when it comes across them rather than go to where function is called 
    - Or you can "step over" functions
(More on Duckett page 477)

- You can set conditional breakpoints

**Try, Catch, FInally**
- Like an if/else statement for errors (Duckett page 480)
