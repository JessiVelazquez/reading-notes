# Research

Describe “The Cloud”

- The Cloud is made up of live servers, housed in data centers, which are access over the internet, and run software and databases that allow clients to run software applications via the web.

What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [source](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

What is auto-scaling?

- The process of scaling up in server bandwidth and therefore computing power on an as-needed basis, driven by application use or website visits.

What is bandwidth?

- The amount of data your server can transfer to clients in a given amount of time

How do cloud providers compute service costs?

- Price is determined based on network traffic to your servers.

# Definitions

**Server Instances:** An instance is a single copy of software running on a single computer. If you run two copies of the same software on the same computer, that would be two instances.

**Containers:** A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [source](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

**Cloud Services:** Services that provide a scalable, server hosting system where clients can pay as needed based on user traffic, to host their websites and applications.

**Cloud Architecture:** the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing. These components typically consist of a front end platform, back end platforms, a cloud based delivery, and a network. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_architecture)

**AWS:** Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud services offering

**EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:** These are both services to host applications in the cloud, however Heroku is easier to learn and can be more expensive at scale, whereas AWS is quite complex and has a more linear price model.
