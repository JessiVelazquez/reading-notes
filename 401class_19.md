# Research

Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

- API Gateway and Lambdas manage backend RESTful routes and CRUD functions like a server does, but are not a server as they are run in AWS. An ExpressJS Server also handles back end routes, but runs on a PORT on your computer and therefore is a full server.

List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

- **Amazon Aurora:** MySQL, PostGresSQL. Fast, cheap.

- **RDS:** easy to use relational.

- **DynamoDB:** key/value, document based. Super fast at scale. Built in security, back up and restore, in memory caching. Used by the Big Names.

- **Elasticache:** just an in memory cache

- **Neptune:** graph database engine, very powerful and fast, readily available, Used by the Big Names.

- **Quantum Ledger:** Ledger database for storing the financial records of a company.

- **Timestream:** Timestream database used for DevOps and sensor data when relational DBs can't work in retreival settings with these data structures.

- **DocumentDB** Amazon's MongoDB compatibility service.

Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

- FIFO queues are an Amazon offering. They support ordering and exactly once processing. [source](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/amazon-sqs-introduces-fifo-queues-with-exactly-once-processing-and-lower-prices-for-standard-queues/#:~:text=FIFO%20queues%20have%20essentially%20the,being%20received%20by%20message%20consumers.)

How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

- You can log messages that did not reach a subscriber endpoint to a queue.

# Definitions

**Serverless API:** An emulation of a server existing in the Cloud, like on AWS. Still comprised of multiple components.

**Triggers:** Events that cause specific functions to fire. The trigger must be set up with the function.

**Dynamo vs Mongo:** Both are NoSQL/doc based, but Dynamo's big difference is that it is fully managed, whereas Mongo is not. Dynamo also provides security out of the box, as well as scaled pricing. A downside is that for search queries recquiring traversals, the data must be pushed to other AWS services to perform it, which significantly increases time. MongoDB's query language allows developers to query and analyze data in many ways; single key, graph traversal, geospatial queries, range, faceted search, and much more. There is minimal latency.

**Dynamoose vs Mongoose:** Dynamo and Mongo's respective oose's. An oose is a Node package that allows Node.js to talk to a database.
