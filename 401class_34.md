# Research

Why is the Context API useful?

- Context allows you to manage state globally from a dedicated component. This means you don't have to pass state and props around all of the time and can customize what state elements you want to manage.

Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

- No, components must be wrapped within the SettingsProvider in a return of a parent component - usually done at a level "above" the meat of the app - like a main.js or app.js.

What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

- Use cases are typically site-wide things - could be setting a global language provider - say you have you have your site translated in 3 different languages, you want the user to be able to change the global state with the click of one menu button, so that all components render in the chosen language. Light mode/dark mode is another common and similar use case for context in React.

Describe “Context Hell”

- When you start to use too many providers wrapping around components in a high level parent component, like app.js or main.js. If you are not just managing state all at one global level, the other option is to have many different state management "providers", and wrap them around components as needed. But this can get super messy and cause conflicts and dirty looking doce if you are not careful.

# Definitions

**global state:** state items that are managed in context and passed to components through Settings Provider files

**global context:** global context would be the master context provider that actually wraps around all components, meaning the state being managed in that context file is global.

**provider:** a file where state is managed in context, exported as a provider, anjd wrapped around React components, giving them access to the state items through the use props.children().

**consumer:** the opposite of a provider - the React omponent that is wrapped by a provider and inherits access to its state items through props.children().
