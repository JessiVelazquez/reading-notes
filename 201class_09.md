# **Forms**

- User inputs data to send to the server
- server processes the data
- server creates new page to send back to user based on input data
- **Name/Value Pairs**
    - Name = prompt/datatype
    - Value = corresponding data from user

**In HTML**
- Forms live inside of ```<form>`` element
    - ```<action>``` attribute (necessary for any form)
        - its value is the URL of the page on the server that receives the data from the form input
        - ```.get``` or ```.post```
            -  Ways to send forms
            - ```.get``` adds input values to end of the URL in the ```action``` attribute
            - ```.post``` sends values in *"HTTP headers"*

**Inputs**
- ```<input>``` element is used to create several different types of input controls:
    - Text = ```type="text"``` attribute
    - Password = ```type="password"``` attribute
    - Text area (multi line text input) = ```<textarea>``` tag
    - Radio Buttion (multiple choice) = ```type="radio"``` attribute
    - Checkbox (like radio button but box) = ```type="checkbox"```
    - Drop down list box = ```<select>```
    - Multiple select box (select multiple options available) = ```<select>``` with ```multiple``` attribute
    - File input box = ```type="file"```
    - Submit button = ```type="submit"```
    - Image button = ```type="image```
    - Button and hidden controls ```<button>``` ```type="hidden"```


# **CSS**

- Bullet point styling can be applied to any rule for HTML elements of ul, ol, and li
    - list style
    - images for bullet points
    - text wrap around marker (positioning the "bullet" in relation to text)
    - ```list-style``` is list shorthand in CSS - works kind of like border shorthand where you just list out the attributes after the call out

- In a table, you can use the varioius HTML table level tags (th, tr, td etc) to style in CSS
    - see Duckett page 338 or cookie-stand project

**Styling Forms**

- You can stylize text inputs, submit buttons, fieldsets, legends
- Form inputs are often different lengths
    - You can stylize them by creating form boxes of even width, each with the ```.title``` and ```.submit``` box, and then setting each title to uniform width and floating left.
- You can change cursor style 

# **Events**

- An event is something that the user does, the browser logs, and your script can react to by performing sets of actions

**Event Selectors Are Listed on Duckett page 246-247**

1. DOM query to select the DOM nodes (elements) you want the script to respond to
    - ```document.getElementByID()``` etc
2. Indicate which event on the selected nodes will trigger a response
3. State the code you want to run when the event opccurs
