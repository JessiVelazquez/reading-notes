# **Lists**

**Ordered Lists**

- Lists where each item is numbered
    - For example a recipe that must be followed in order

- ```<ol>``` HTML tag for list
    - ```<li>``` HTML tag for each item in list

**Unordered Lists**

- Lists that begin with a bullet point.

- ```<ul>``` HTML tag for the list
    - ```<li>``` HTML tag for each item in list

**Definition Lists**

- Lists that include a definition for each item

- ```<dl>``` HTML tag for the list
    - ```<dt>``` for each item in list
        - ```<dd>``` for the definition of each list item

Lists can be nested within other lists

# **Boxes**

In CSS, you can place boxes around HTML elements.

- Controlled with width and height either in pixels or in percentage of browser window or box containing box in question

- ** LImiting Width and Height**
    - Use ```min-width``` or ```max-width``` (and height) to control the size of the box based on the size of the user's screen

- Overflow controls ```hidden``` and ```scroll``` control what to do if the content of box is larger than the box itself

- **Box Properties:**

    - Border (every box has one, even if invisible)
        - Properties are width, style, color
    - Margin (space around the outside of the box)
    - Padding (space between edge of box and contents of box)
    - You can center a box by setting the left and right margins to "auto"
    - Display property controls inline vs block for boxes
    - Visibility property allows you to hide boxes from sight
    - Border images (details Duckett page 319)
    - Box shadows (details Duckett page 320)
    - Rounded Corners 9details Duckett page 321)
    - Elliptical sha

# **Javascript - Switch Statements**

- Like if/else statements, but exist in one code block
- ```switch``` calls the variable
- Each ```case``` defines a potentual value for the variable and tells what code to run if that case is met

**Type Coercion**
- Javascript will change the data type of a value to complete an expression, this is known as "weak typing" ("strong typing is when you define the data type for each variable)
- To combat this and ensure it does not occur unexpectedly, use "strict equals" in statements: ```===```

**Truthy/Falsy**
- Allows you to run an expression with just one operand:
    ```
    if (document.getElementbyID('header')) {
        do something
    } else {
        do something else
    }
    ```
    *In this code, the if statement has just one operand, which either evaluates to truthy or falsy*
    (source: Duckett page 168)

**Loops**

- Loops check a condition. If it returns **true**, a code block will run. Then, the condition will be checked again and if it still returns **true**, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns **false**.

**For Loops**
- Condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.
- This is a **for** loop. if variable (i) is less than 10, the code inside the curly braces is run. Then the counter is incremented by 1, and if i is still less than 10, it runs again.
```
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    documents.write(i);
}
```
(source: Duckett page 170)

**While Loops**
- If you do not know how many times the loop should run, usually use a **while** loop.
- Condition is something other than a counter, and as long as the condition evaluates to **True**, the loop runs.
- A ***Do While*** loop is similar to a ***While*** loop, except that it will always run the code inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to *false*.

**Loop Counters**

Initialization

```
var i = 0;
```

Condition

```
i < 10;
```

Update
```
i++
```
